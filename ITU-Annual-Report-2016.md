# ITU Annual Report 2016
Report on the Implementation of the Strategic Plan and Activities of the Union  
October 4, 2017  

# Strategic Goals of the Union

The Connect 2020 Agenda was adopted by the 2014 Plenipotentiary Conference as part of ITU's strategic plan for the 2016-2019 quadrennium. 
At the heart of the Agenda and the ITU Strategic Plan are four goals, relating to:

 - Growth – enabling and fostering acceses to and increased use of ICTs.
 - Inclusiveness – bridging the digital divide and providing broadband for all.
 - Sustainability – managing challenges resulting from ICT development.
 - Innovation and partnership – leading, improving and adapting to the changing technology environment.
 
The four goals include 17 targets, designed to provide an indication of whether each of the goals is being achieved up to 2020 and to help ITU and other stakeholders to focus their priorities during that period.




## Goal 1: Growth

Enabling and fostering access to and increased use of ICTs.

Goal 1: Growth, is measured using the following three targets:

 - Target 1.1: Worldwide, 55 per cent of households should have access to the Internet by 2020.
 - Target 1.2: Worldwide, 60 per cent of individuals should be using the Internet by 2020.
 - Target 1.3: Worldwide, telecommunications/ICTs should be 40 per cent more affordable by 2020.
 
### Target 1.1: Worldwide, 55 per cent of households should have access to the Internet by 2020.

As noted in figures 1 and 2, the indicators used to highlight progress in relation to targets 1.1 and 1.2 show that in 2016, 52.3% of households and 47% of individuals globally are estimated to have access / be using the Internet, two percent and three percent, respectively, more than in 2015.


### Target 1.3: Worldwide, telecommunications/ICTs should be 40 per cent more affordable by 2020.


## Goal 2: Inclusiveness

Bridging the digital divide and providing broadband for all.

## Goal 3: Sustainability

Managing challenges resulting from ICT development.

## Goal 4: Innovation and partnership

Lead, improve and adapt to the changing telecommunication/ICT environment.


# Radiocommunication Sector Objectives

Following the World Radiocommunication Conference 2015 (WRC-15), the updated version of the Radio Regulations (Edition of 2016) was published in December 2016 and made freely available to the public. The Conference approved various resolutions relating to the preparation of WRC-19 and WRC-23. The preparatory studies requested by these resolutions are being conducted within ITU-R, with the support of the regional groups and other international organizations.

On 12 December 2016 in Geneva, the ITU celebrated the 110th anniversary of the Radio Regulations. This gave the opportunity to showcase 110 years of successful development and implementation of this major treaty, which enables the radiocommunication ecosystem to exist in a sustainable manner. Celebrations included two panel discussions about the ITU Radio Regulations' impact on the ICT industry, and the challenges, opportunities, and future of the ITU Radio Regulations. The event was attended by over 540 participants from 106 countries. Present and former officials of the Union, present and former members of the Radio Regulations Board (RRB), and ITU-R and former CCIR Study Group Chairmen were also present.

Throughout the year, ITU-R continued to process space and terrestrial notices and other related activities. ITU-R software was improved and new applications were delivered.

The Radio Regulations Board met three times and approved new or modified Rules of Procedures related to WRC-15 decisions. Significant progress was registered in the reduction of interference cases from Italy into television services of its neighbors.

New and revised Recommendations were approved; numerous reports were published. Assistance was provided to members, especially in developing countries, and capacity building activities were carried out including a World Radiocommunication Seminar (WRS-16), two Regional Radiocommunication Seminars and a Small Satellite Symposium, among others.

## Objective R.1

Meet, in a rational, equitable, efficient, economical and timely way, the ITU membership's requirements for radio-frequency spectrum and satellite-orbit resources, while avoiding harmful interference.

#### R.1-7 Improvement of ITU-R software

The BR develops, updates and maintains a significant number of software applications and databases to assist in the implementation of the Radio Regulations and Rules of Procedure, and in particular to enable timely processing, examination and publication of the relevant terrestrial frequency notifications and satellite network filings. In order to take into account the evolution of the Radio Regulations and associated Rules of Procedure, the evolution of technology and security factors, these software applications and databases need continuing development and maintenance. In 2016, the ITU-R software and data bases benefited from the following elements:

 - Migration of the Global Administration Data System (GLAD) database from Ingres to SQL server, development of a new interface for updating GLAD information and creation of a new layout for the publication of GLAD information on the web.
 - Development of a web application providing online access to the MIFR for all terrestrial services.
 - Delivery of new and/or improved versions of space services processing software for external use (BR IFIC (Space)).
 - Delivery of a new space services database scheme design, in response to WRC-15 and RRB decisions. The software and the new database were presented to the membership at WRS-16 and through circular letters CR/389, CR/393, CR/394, CR/403, and CR/411.
 - Integration of two third-party software packages into the space services technical examinations software suite (GIBC), to allow for equivalent power-flux density (EPFD) validation calculations. This was presented to membership at WRS-16 and through circular letters CR/405 and CR/414.
 - Maintenance of the SpaceWISC system for online submission and publication of advance publication information for space services networks subject to coordination. In parallel, a new system has been developed to implement the extension of the scope of Resolution 908 (WRC-12) from API to coordination and notification, as decided by WRC-15. The first deliverable is the as-received publication web site mentioned in circular letters CR/401 and CR/415.
 - Steps toward the implementation of a database and corresponding web application for submission and publication of harmful interference reports for space services (SIRRS). The look and feel of the system was presented to membership at WRS-16 and the system will be available for external testing by the end of first quarter 2017.
 - Delivery of new and updated versions of the reference databases (including new data and schemes) needed for the technical and regulatory examinations by the BR of terrestrial frequency assignments in the bands shared between terrestrial and space services, taking into account WRC-15 and RRB decisions.
 - At the request of WP4A (Doc. 4A/669 Annex 14), implementation of changes in the way affected networks are indicated in the space systems technical examination software and database and made available a new website with information on affected networks (Notex). This new functionality was described in CR/397.
 - Delivery of new and updated versions of all terrestrial services processing software, both for internal (TerRaSys) and external (BR IFIC (Terrestrial)) use, including improved database schemas and updated validation and examination software modules for the submission of terrestrial frequency notifications, as a consequence of WRC-15 and RRB decisions. The software enhancements and new requirements were presented to membership at WRS-16 and through the relevant circular letters.

# Telecommunication Standardization Sector Objectives

 - The ITU-T Focus Group on network aspects of IMT-2020 ('5G') has concluded its preliminary study into the wireline networking innovations required to achieve the ambitious performance targets of 5G systems. The group's output takes the form of five draft ITU international standards and four draft ITU technical reports to drive related work in ITU's standardization expert groups (ITU-T Study Groups). The Focus Group's final meeting in December 2016 hosted a "workshop and demo day" showcasing proofs of concept and demonstrations of the wireline technologies to enable future 5G systems.
 - The ITU-T Focus Group on Digital Financial Services has concluded its work with the publication of 85 policy recommendations and 28 supporting thematic reports. The Focus Group brought together more than 60 organizations from over 30 countries to drive greater financial inclusion for the estimated 2 billion people still without access to a bank account.
 - ITU-T has completed a set of highly anticipated broadband access technologies. G.fast was updated in 2016 to achieve up to 2 Gbit/s access speeds over traditional telephone wires. A new series of standards for 40-Gigabit-capable Fiber to the Home (NG-PON2) are the first to provide fiber-optic access speeds beyond 10 Gbit/s. ITU-T boasts another major recent achievement in the revision of a key ITU standard underlying the Optical Transport Network, concluding a three-year process to enable optical transport at rates higher than 100 Gbit/s.
 - Now in its fourth edition, ITU H.265 'High Efficiency Video Coding' – the successor to the Primetime Emmy award-winning ITU H.264 'Advanced Video Coding' – offers double the compression power of H.264 to provide the platform for the next decade of innovation in video. ITU-T Study Group 16 and the ISO/IEC Moving Picture s Expert Group are inviting experts to submit evidence supporting the case for a future video coding standard beyond today's ITU H.265.
 - The United for Smart Sustainable Cities (U4SSC) initiative was established, primarily to advocate for public policy to ensure that ICTs play a definitive role in smart cities. U4SSC is supported by 16 United Nations agencies and programmes and is open to the participation of all stakeholders interested in driving smart-city innovation. The collaboration driven by this initiative has led 51 cities to join the pilot project implementing ITU's Key Performance Indicators for Smart Sustainable Cities.
 - Held in Hammamet, Tunisia, from 25 October to 3 November 2016, WTSA-16 produced 16 new resolutions, 31 revised resolutions and 5 new standards. The directives of WTSA-16 call for ITU to expand its study of the wireline networking innovations necessary to support 5G systems. ITU members also reaffirmed the importance of ITU standardization work for ultra-high-speed transport networks, future video technologies, IoT, and smart cities and communities.
